파이썬은 언어입니다. 파이썬은 컴퓨터를 사용하는 단순한 도구가 아닙니다. Python으로 작성된 코드는 컴퓨터에게 일을 지시하는 수단에 그치지 않습니다. 문제를 함께 해결하고자 하는 동료들과의 소통 수단이기도 합니다. 그래서 가독성이 좋은 코드의 조건 중 하나가 됩니다. 이는 파이썬이 언어라는 확실한 근거가 됩니다.
　
언어의 학습에서는 이해와 숙달이 함께 필요합니다. 파이썬이라는 언어를 학습할 때도 마찬가지입니다. 사고력과 끈기를 키워야 합니다. 그래서 연습문제가 필요합니다. 이것이 문해력을 뜻하는 ‘리터러시’라는 단어를 연습문제 책 이름에 넣은 이유입니다. 파이썬 입문서와 함께 공부하며 언어로서의 파이썬의 기본기를 다질 수 있도록 도울 수 있는 문제들을 이 책, ""Python 리터러시""에 담았습니다."
